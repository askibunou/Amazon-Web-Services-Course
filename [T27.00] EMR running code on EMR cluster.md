# [T27.00] EMR: running code on EMR cluster

## Documentation:

- [AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty 2022 - Hands On!](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-data-analytics/): Section 04 (89 - 90)
- [AWS::EMR::Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-elasticmapreduce-cluster.html)

## Description:

Create an AWS EMR cluster using AWS Console. Add steps to that cluster to run Spark jobs for OBT.

Files for pushing to CodeComet:

- Script name: `obt_datawarehouse_t20.py`
- CloudFormation template: `{user_id}_obt_datawarehouse_t20.yaml`
- `install_dependencies.sh`

## Amazon Development:

1. Use advanced options to create a cluster.
2. Use emr-6.8.0 release and choose Spark and Hadoop for Software configuration.
3. Leave as default next options on that page and add steps.
4. The first step will be the job for OBT from analytics folder (from [T24.00]). Cluster should be terminated if something went wrong.
5. The second step will be the job for OBT from datawarehouse folder. Create as previous step.
6. Leave only Master Node. Choose m5.xlarge instance type (for new console remove core properties, removing instance group).
7. Auto termination should be set for 5 minutes.
8. Leave as default remaining options and click next.
9. Set cluster name: `{user_id}_obt`
10. **Set Tags Owner=aws-edu-iba-gomel and StudentName={user_id}**
11. Edit `dependencies/install_depencies.sh` in your repo, enter with your bucket name and upload it to your bucket dependencies folder.
12. Add bootstrap actions.
13. Use EMR_DefaultRole_V2 and EMR_EC2_DefaultRole
14. Click next and create cluster.
15. Wait and see logs of your steps.
16. Create AWS CloudFormation template to create EMR cluster (`obt_datawarehouse_t20.yaml`) and add steps for your OBT jobs. Your cluster parameters should be the same as in steps 1-13.
17. Test CloudFormation Template:
    1. Deploy (check that your EMR cluster has been created using CloudFormation)
    2. Delete your CloudFormation Stack
18. Open Pull Request as described in Common Info (Task Workflow) section.
