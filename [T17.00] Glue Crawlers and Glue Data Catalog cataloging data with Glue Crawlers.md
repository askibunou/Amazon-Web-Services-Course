# [T17.00] Glue Crawlers and Glue Data Catalog: cataloging data with Glue Crawlers

## Documentation:

- [Data Catalog and crawlers in AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.html)
- [AWS::Glue::Crawler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-glue-crawler.html)

## Description:

Create AWS Glue crawlers for dimensions (dim_go_methods_analytics, dim_currency_analytics, dim_time_period_analytics). All neccesary steps are below.

Files for pushing to CodeComet:

- CloudFormation template: `{user_id}_dim_go_methods_analytics_t17.yaml`, `{user_id}_dim_currency_analytics_t17.yaml`, `{user_id}_dim_time_period_analytics_t17.yaml`

## Amazon Development:

1. Create a crawler: {user_id}_{dimension_name}_t12.
2. **Mandatory Steps:**
   1. **Target Database = aws_edu_analytics**
   2. **Table Prefix = {user_id}_**
   3. **Set Tags Owner=aws-edu-iba-gomel and StudentName={user_id}**
3. Launch your crawlers. After crawlers have been completed, check your created tables with all needed fields in Glue Data Catalog.
4. Create AWS CloudFormation template for Crawlers with the name: `{user_id}_dim_go_methods_analytics_t17.yaml`, `{user_id}_dim_currency_analytics_t17.yaml`, `{user_id}_dim_time_period_analytics_t17.yaml`.
5. Test CloudFormation Template:
   1. Deploy (check that your Crawlers has been created using CloudFormation)
   2. Delete your CloudFormation Stack
6. Open Pull Request as described in Common Info (Task Workflow) section.
