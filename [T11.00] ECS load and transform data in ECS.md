# [T11.00] ECS: load and transform data in ECS

## Documentation:

- [AWS SDK for pandas](https://aws-sdk-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Cloud formation for ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html)

## Description:

Create AWS ECS Task definitions that invokes python job which copies and transforms dim_time_period data from AWS S3 Raw bucket to AWS S3 Stage bucket.

Files for pushing to CodeComet:

- Script name: `dim_time_period_stage_t6.py`
- CloudFormation template: `{user_id}_dim_time_period_stage_t6.yaml`.
- `Dockerfile`
- `requirements.txt`

## Configuration:

1. Path: `configurations/dim_time_period.yaml`
2. Use `raw-to-stage` section
3. Read data from `[data-source][s3][keys]`
4. Write data to `[data-target][s3][keys]`
5. Replace `{user_id}` with your aws account name for target path

## ECS Environment Variables:

- **UserId** = `{user_id}`
- **ConfigBucketKey** = `configurations/{configuration_file_name}.yaml`
- **ConfigBucketName** = `aws-data-engineering-course-{user-id}-assets`

## Local Development:

1. Create Python Application:
   1. Ingest config file from S3 using commons.
   2. Get S3 client and read data from the source ingesting only max ingest_dt data using boto3 to filter unneeded paths to read.
   3. Read data from AWS S3 Raw bucket using awswrangler.
   4. Add column 'ingest_dt' that is equal to ingest_dt from the read path.
   5. Add column 'audit_ts' that is equal to current timestamp.
   6. Load data to the target use awswrangler as parquet.
2. Create Dockerfile:
   1. Base image - python:3.9.
   2. Add all python dependencies and libs to your image.
   3. Build Docker image.

## Amazon Development:

1. Push Docker images to registry with tag: `{user_id}_dim_time_period_stage_t6`
2. Create Task Definition with name: `{user_id}_dim_time_period_stage_t6`
3. Configuration:
   1. Task CPU = .25 vCPU
   2. Task memory = .25 GB
   3. App environment = EC2
4. **Mandatory Steps:**
   1. **Set Environment variables**
   2. **Set Tags Owner=aws-edu-iba-gomel and StudentName={user_id}**
5. Add necessary options to create an ECS Task Definition, test an ECS Task Definition and check logs in AWS CloudWatch.
6. Create AWS CloudFormation template for ECS Task Definition with the name: `{user_id}_dim_time_period_stage_t6.yaml`.
7. Test CloudFormation Template:
   1. Deploy (check that your ECS Task Definition has been created using CloudFormation)
   2. Delete your CloudFormation Stack
8. Open Pull Request as described in Common Info (Task Workflow) section.
