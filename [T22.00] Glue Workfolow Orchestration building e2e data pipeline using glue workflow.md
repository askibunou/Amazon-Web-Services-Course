# Description:

Create Glue Workflow with the same Job Flow for dim_currency, fact_go_daily_sales. The workflow is started manually

Files for pushing to CodeComet:

- CloudFormation template: `{user_id}_dim_currency_t16`, `{user_id}_fact_go_daily_sales_t16`

# Amazon Development:

1. Create a Glue Workflow on cluster with the name: `{user_id}_dim_currency_t16`, `{user_id}_fact_go_daily_sales_t16`.
2. Job Flow:
```
raw --> stage --> analytics --> crawler --> datawarehouse
```
3. Create AWS CloudFormation template for Glue Workflow with name `{user_id}_dim_currency_t16`, `{user_id}_fact_go_daily_sales_t16`.
4. Test CloudFormation Template:
   1. Deploy (check that your Glue Workflow has been created using CloudFormation)
   2. Delete your CloudFormation Stack
5. Open Pull Request as described in Common Info (Task Workflow) section.
