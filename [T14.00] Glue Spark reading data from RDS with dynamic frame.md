# [T14.00] Glue Spark: reading data from RDS with dynamic frame

## Documentation:

- [Connection types and options for ETL in AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-connect.html)
- [AWS Glue write parquet with partitions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49141713/aws-glue-write-parquet-with-partitions)
- [AWS::Glue::Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-glue-job.html)

## Description:

Create AWS Glue Spark Job that copies go_daily_sales data from AWS RDS to Raw S3 bucket. Available hours for RDS database (Monday-Friday 9:00 -15:00 Minsk timezone). Check if RDS postgres has already available, if it is stopped turn it on, running lambda ```rds_start_postgres_database```. 

Files for pushing to CodeComet:

- Script name: `fact_go_daily_sales_raw_t9.py`
- CloudFormation template: `{user_id}_fact_go_daily_sales_raw_t9.yaml`

## Configuration:

1. Path: `configurations/fact_go_daily_sales.yaml`
2. Use `source-to-raw` section
3. Read data from `[data-source][database]`
4. Write data to `[data-target][s3][keys]`
5. Replace `{user_id}` with your aws account name for target path

## Glue Parameters:

1. To represent Glue Flow developing locally you need to set parameters as it would on the cluster.
2. You can do this with sys.argv.append command before using getResolvedOptions function from awsglue folder in your repository.
3. Parameters that you will need to set:

- **UserId** = `{user_id}`
- **ConfigBucketKey** = `configurations/{configuration_file_name}.yaml`
- **ConfigBucketName** = `aws-data-engineering-course-{user-id}-assets`

## Local Development:

1. Ingest config file from S3 using commons package in your repository.
2. Get DB Info and Credentials from AWS SecretsManager using SecretId that is stored in config.
3. Read data from AWS RDS using DynamicFrame
4. Add column 'ingest_dt' that matches the current date.
5. Setting spark config for partitioning (spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode=dynamic).
6. Load data as partitioned by 'ingest_dt' in target bucket.

## Amazon Development:

1. Create a Glue Spark Job on cluster with the name: `{user_id}_fact_go_daily_sales_raw_t9`.
2. **Mandatory Steps:**
   1. **Choose Python 3.9 for Python version**
   2. **Choose 1/16 DPU for data processing units**
   3. **Choose 0 retries**
   4. **Set timeout for 5**
   5. **Set your bucket path for Script path**
   6. **Set parameters**
   7. **Set Tags Owner=aws-edu-iba-gomel and StudentName={user_id}**
3. Add necessary options to create a Glue Spark Job, test a Glue Spark Job and check logs in AWS CloudWatch.
4. Create AWS CloudFormation template for Glue Spark Job with the name: `{user_id}_fact_go_daily_sales_raw_t9.yaml`.
5. Test CloudFormation Template:
   1. Deploy (check that your Glue Python Shell has been created using CloudFormation)
   2. Delete your CloudFormation Stack
6. Open Pull Request as described in Common Info (Task Workflow) section.
